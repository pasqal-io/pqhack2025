PQHack is an hackathon aimed at the quantum computing community in Portugal. Whether you are a veteran quantum physicist or a coding enthusiast curious about quantum computers, it is a unique event to learn about the exciting possibilities offered by the quantum world!

The 2025 edition will be an in-person event on the **8th and 9th of February**, hosted by the 
**<a href="https://www.up.pt/portal/en/" target="_blank">University of Porto</a>** 
in collaboration with 
**<a href="https://www.pasqal.com/" target="_blank">Pasqal</a>** and the 
**<a href="https://www.uc.pt/en/" target="_blank">University of Coimbra</a>**.

In this innovative event, you will compete to solve a set of **quantum computing coding challenges** proposed by our team of experts. But you have to be quick! You will only have **twenty four hours** to deliver your solution. To be successful, you will need to collaborate in a team.

Don't wait too long - there is a limit of 40 participants.
The registration deadline is **January 15**. [**Apply now!**]("https://www.google.com/")

## When and where?

- The full event will last from February 8 at 11:00 until February 9 at 16:30. There will be an initial session, a hacking period of 24h, an evaluation period, and a closing session.

- This will be an in-person event, hosted at the Department of Physics of the <a href="https://www.up.pt/fcup/pt/" target="_blank">Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto</a> (Rua do Campo Alegre 4169-007 Porto).
